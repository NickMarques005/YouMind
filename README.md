## Project Description

The YouMind mobile application is developed using React Native, enabling high-performance, cross-platform capabilities. The application integrates seamlessly with the T-Watch via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi, ensuring efficient and secure data communication. The project is hosted on two virtual machines: one for processing server-side logic and another for database management.

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Login and Registration**: Easy-to-use interfaces for new users to register and existing users to log in.
- **OTP (One-Time Password)**: Identity verification through email codes.
- **Password Reset**: Secure process for password recovery.

### Medical Professionals' Interface

- **Home**: Intuitive navigation among the appâ€™s functionalities.
- **Profile**: Update personal information, profile picture, and general settings.
- **Notepad**: Secure tool for taking important treatment notes.
- **Analysis**: View patient performance metrics to gain treatment insights.
- **Treatment**: Search for patients, start and end treatments, view general and specific treatment data.
- **Chat**: Secure communication with each patient in treatment.

### Patients' Interface

- **Home**: Quick access to main functionalities and data.
- **Profile**: Update personal information, profile picture, and general settings.
- **Treatment**: Search for doctors, start treatments, access chat with responsible doctor (without the ability to end or alter treatment).
- **Health**: Set of main functionalities for health management:
  - **Call CVV**: Direct call to CVV (suicide prevention hotline).
  - **Medications**: Add, update, and remove medications with alert scheduling.
  - **Questionnaires**: Daily mental health questionnaires with response monitoring.

## Technologies Used

### Front-end

- **React Native**: Framework for mobile development.
- **React**: Used for specific password reset applications.

### Back-end

- **Node.js**: Server-side logic.
- **Socket.io**: Bidirectional communication for chat and application state updates.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, medications, questionnaires, treatment history, notifications, messages, and notes.
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queue for scalable task management.
- **Node.js Agenda**: Library for task scheduling.
- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication, push notifications, and audio file storage (.m4a) for chats.
- **Nodemailer and OAuth2**: Secure email sending for password changes, important updates, and other communications.

## Architecture

The architecture is composed of various components integrated to provide a secure and seamless experience:

- **BLE and Wi-Fi Communication**: Ensures efficient and secure data transmission between the mobile device and T-Watch.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user authentication with high security.
- **Push Notifications**: Ensures real-time communication with users.
- **Email System**: Uses Nodemailer and OAuth2 for secure email communications.
- **Task Management**: Combines Amazon SQS and Node.js Agenda for scalable and resilient task scheduling.
